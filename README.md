# Modelling-of-Robotic-Arms
Replication of: "Kinematic Modelling and Motion Mapping of Robotic Arms"
This project focuses on the **kinematic modeling and motion mapping of a 6-DOF hydraulic robotic arm**, emphasizing both forward and inverse kinematics. Using the Denavit-Hartenberg method for transformation matrices, MATLAB simulations were conducted to validate analytical calculations. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for enhanced interaction and data visualization. The project addresses slower response times in hydraulic actuators through a proposed PID control loop, aiming to optimize load handling and system responsiveness. By bridging analytical and computational methods, this study provides valuable insights into robotic arm control and performance optimization.
